# FallDetector

Application detects fall detection of user using algorithm based on LinearAccelerometer, Magnetic and Rotation Vector Sensor. If fall is detected it sends alert via SMS or/and e-mail with time, user's profile and location of the event with the link to the Google Maps.
Precision of the algorithm is equals to 74%. Modules of the application allows to register linear acceleration, gyroscope, magnetic sensor and rotation vector sensors signals and test registered signals for the occurrence of fall. It was made as a part of my BSc Thesis.
